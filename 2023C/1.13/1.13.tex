\subsection{Problem Background}

Wordle, developed by Jonathan Feinberg in 2008, was created 
to help students expand their vocabulary. However, due to its
simple gameplay, it quickly went viral on social media at the 
end of 2021 and was later acquired by The New York Times in 2022, 
integrating it into their online games section. It is a web-based 
game with two difficulty modes: easy and hard. It focuses on user 
experience and game logic, and there are many variations of the game, 
such as Quordle (guessing 4 words simultaneously), Octordle 
(guessing 8 words simultaneously), and Worldle (a geography version where 
players guess a country or region). The rules for the hard mode are as follows.

\subsection{Restatement of the Problem}

We need to analyze the data provided by The New York Times and address the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}  % 无序列表
        \item \textbf{Problem 1:}Develop a model to explain the variations in the daily reported results and predict the 
        range of reported results for March 1, 2023. Additionally, analyze which word attributes influence 
        players' decisions to select Hard Mode.
        \item \textbf{Problem 2:}Build a prediction model to estimate the percentage distribution of results (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, X) 
        for a future day, with specific predictions for "EERIE" on March 1, 2023, and assess the model's accuracy.
        \item \textbf{Problem 3:}Develop a classification model to categorize words by difficulty level and identify their attributes. 
        Conduct a detailed analysis for "EERIE" and evaluate the model's accuracy.
        \item \textbf{Problem 4:}Explore and describe any other interesting insights or patterns found within the data.
